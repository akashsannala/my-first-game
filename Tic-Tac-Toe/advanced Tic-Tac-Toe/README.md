# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play against each other or against an AI opponent.

## File Structure

The project files are organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the game.
- `css/normalize.css`: A CSS file that provides consistent styling across different browsers.
- `css/style.css`: A CSS file that defines the styles for the game elements.
- `script.js`: A JavaScript file that handles the game logic and interaction.

## Dependencies

The game relies on the following files and resources:

- `img/icon.svg`: An SVG file used as the game's icon.
- `img/github.svg`: An SVG file used to display the GitHub logo in the footer.
- `font/TicTacToe.ttf`: A TrueType Font file used to display a custom font for the game.

## Browser Compatibility

The Tic Tac Toe game is compatible with modern web browsers that support HTML, CSS3, and ECMAScript 6 (ES6) features.
